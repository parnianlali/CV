       This project delivers a unified framework for next generation wearable health monitoring by combining the unique advantages of fiber optic sensors with cutting‑edge AI techniques. 
       After an in‑depth survey of sensor architectures, calibration methods, and performance metrics,
       it presents a data‑driven pipeline—from real‑time acquisition and annotation through preprocessing,
       feature extraction, and the design, training, and hyperparameter tuning of machine learning models
       (predominantly supervised learning)—inspired by a comprehensive review of numerous articles and 
       culminating in rigorous evaluation against clinical benchmarks.

      description: >-
        I began my research with game theory, focusing on enhancing cooperation among players
        using reinforcement learning. As I continued studying and reviewing related literature,
        I expanded my work into multi-agent systems, investigating cooperation between agents.
        Currently, my research centers on mean-field game theory and the implementation of both
        centralized and decentralized reinforcement learning for agents. This project is still 
        ongoing, but I expect to produce a publishable paper from it within the coming months.
